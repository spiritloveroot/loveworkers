## vision for this collaboration team 

from feeling the energy created in our group(s) thus far, i can see that everyone is envisioning something very similar

a challenge for me over the years has been uniting and interlinking efforts like these — it seems there is a great convergence and concrescence now occurring in this beautiful liminal space 

so my vision is that we will continue to coalesce and be a part of co-creating the big dream together — rainbow warriors — rainbow bridge — open world alliance — gaianet — etc

this kind of work is (i believe) what my whole life is about — most of all i think about — within the domain of this lovework, i have unlimited energy just about

practically speaking, the next steps in the vision as i see them are figuring out a way to organize and coalesce, continuing to be project-focused where we are actively working towards the building up of the superstructure/meta-architecture which will enable us all to exchange in that free and easy way we all dream of while being able to lift ourselves and others up to higher and higher potentials in the process

## values

when i was seeking a romantic life partner 
i distilled what i was looking for
down to six core values

free spirit
intuitive/deep thinker
compassionate/empathic
fierce lover
independent-minded/non-conformist
adventurous

so these values 
also express who i am
in that they show what kind of energy
i like to integrate with most

others values that describe
who i am and what i desire

authenticity
beauty
community
creativity
fairness
harmony
poise (under pressure)
spirituality 
wisdom...

## needs

first and foremost
i need a team to collaborate with
i have a lot of ideas
and i want to start manifesting them into reality
by co-creating with others

my more personal goals
which i was aiming towards in the near future
before i was thrust into this amazing convergence

1: podcast to unite loveworkers of the world
2: learn wordpress web design
3: build social media content processing skills 
4: write & publish books
5: build eco skills (for buying land in 1-2 yrs)

the first 3 may include some small financial costs for web hosting and digital tools

the 4th mostly doesn't cost much while i am learning but there will be financial costs associated when we begin to build our permaculture homestead — we are actively saving up 

i am looking for any collaborators in any way for these initiatives — the basic idea is to transition away from the current green dollar job i have right now and begin aligning my everyday life with how i
